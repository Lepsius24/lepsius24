            The problem with Line of Fire is that even though we recorded all the songs, we weren't very good. And when we <i>were</i> that good, the recording quality 
            was too bad to ever be used for anything.
            <br><br>
            We still want to record this, but being split between two different cities at the moment, and with Phoebe running a second band, it's anyone's guess when
            Line Of Fire will finally see the light of day.
