            <br><br>
            We wrote all of these songs in about a week while rehearsing for the december Obliques show. 
            Recorded in an afternoon at Jackson's house on a little 2-track recorder. 
            <br><br>
            Playing without a drummer was very strange, but very fun. It also made editing these much, much, easier.

            <br> I'm not a fan of how this turned out. My guitar parts are horrifically unprepared, and there's barely any bass in
            recording. That's literal- the bass frequencies are just <i>gone.</i> 
            <br><br>
            [no shade to jackson, of course]
            <br><br>
            It's a shame because I think these are some of the best songs Phoebe's written. I geniunely think stickers is a top 10 ever-written song.
